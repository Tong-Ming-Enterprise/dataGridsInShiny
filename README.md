<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of datagridxlr is to provide a Shiny wrapper for the Javascript package [datagrdXL](https://www.datagridxl.com).  Mostly this is so I can practice what I learned in [JavaScript for R](https://book.javascript-for-r.com).

## Installation

You can install the development version of datagridxlr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("michael-dewar/datagridxlr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(datagridxlr)
## basic example code
```
